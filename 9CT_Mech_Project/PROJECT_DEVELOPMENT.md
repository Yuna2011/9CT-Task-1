# 9CT Assessment Task 1
### By Yuna Shin

## __Requirments Outline__
### __Defining the Purpose__
#### Write 2-3 sentences explaining what your robot is deisgned to do in the challenge:
I need to design a program for the EV3 robot to navigate around the green and blue blocks using the colour sensor and ultrasonic sensor while picking up or moving the yellow and red blocks.

### __Identify Key Actions__
#### List at least 3-5 specific actions your robot needs to perform to complete the task. These should be clear, simple actions like moving, turning, detecting something or triggering an event (e.g. sound or lights):
1. Detecting the green, blue, red and yellow blocks
2. Turning 90° or going around when green and blue blocks is detected
3. Moving or picking up the red and yellow blocks if it is detected
4. Returning the red and yellow blocks to the starting "box"

### __Functional Requirements__
#### A functional requirement is the action or bhevious the robot needs to perform. For each key action, write a functional requirement that clearly states what the robot must do. These should be written in a clear and concise manner:
*Object Detection* : The robot must stop when the ultrasonic sensor detects an object within 10cm and detect the colour

*Green/Blue Detection* : The robot must turn 90° or go around the object if the colour sensor detects that it is green or blue

*Yellow/Red Detections* : The robot must move towards the objects if the colour sensor detects that it is yellow or red and _______ pick it up??

### __Use Cases__
#### A use case describes a specific situation or scanerio where the robot will perform that action. Write a use case for each functional requirement describing a scenario where the robot will perform the required action.
Scenario : The robot is navigating a path and encounters an obstacle

Inputs : The ultrasonic sensor detects an object within 10 cm

Inputs : The colour sensor detects the colour
